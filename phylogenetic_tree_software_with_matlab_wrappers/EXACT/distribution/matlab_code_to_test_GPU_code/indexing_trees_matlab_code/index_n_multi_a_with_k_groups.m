% this function indexes all ways to break n elements into groups of size a(1), a(2), ..., a(k)
% there are n choose (a(1) , a(2) , ..., a(k) ) ix
% the ix variable can take values 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ...
% the output groups will be concatenated. we now how to read them based on the size of a

% a is a vector

    groups = nan(1 , sum(a) ); %this is a vector of size equal to the sum of all elements in a

    free_elem = 1:n;  % this is a vector with all elements from 1 to n. Maybe it can be hard coded into   int free_elem[13] = {1, 2, 3, â€¦, 13};

    k = length(a);
